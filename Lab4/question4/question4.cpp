Create a Text class that contains a string object to hold the text
of a file. Give it two constructors: a default constructor and a
constructor that takes a string argument that is the name of the
file to open. When the second constructor is used, open the file
and read the contents into the string member object. Add a member
function contents() to return the strings so (for example) it can
be printed. In main(), open a file using Text and print the contents.
