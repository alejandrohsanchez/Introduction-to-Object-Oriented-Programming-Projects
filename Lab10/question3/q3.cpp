/*
3. [Exercise 10 on Page 260] Use a stack<int> and build a Fibonacci sequence on the stack. The programâ€™s
command line should take the number of Fibonacci elements desired, and you should have a loop that looks at the
last two elements on the stack and pushes a new one for every pass through the loop. [35 pts]
